### About Me

Here is an image:

And here is a [link](../index.html).
  
I am currently working as the Associate Director of Strategic Content at Cleveland's Great Lakes Science Center, where I draw upon narrative storytelling techniques to develop dynamic, immersive learning experiences for youth and family audiences. These include three 7,000-square-foot special exhibitions on topics ranging from adhesives to automobiles; a suite of outdoor programming exploring the engineering design process (including tech dissections and a car take-apart); and a permanent exhibit honoring NASA astronaut Guy Bluford. 
  
Prior to entering the museum world, I spent three years acquiring and editing children’s books for Macmillan's Roaring Brook Press, building a foundation interpreting complex social and scientific themes for young audiences. There, I worked on National Book Award Finalist "Most Dangerous" by Steve Sheinkin among other projects for young readers. My own notable acquisitions include a trilogy for the Scripps National Spelling Bee; Robert F. Sibert Informational Book Medal Honoree “Not So Different” by Shane Burcaw; and a yet-to-be-released middle-grade biography of NASA engineer Margaret Hamilton. 
  
Currently, I am leading the creative development for a dynamic new STEM-themed park and playground opening in Hough in October of 2022, as well as a set of complementary indoor exhibits focused on manufacturing. I hold a bachelor's degree from Cornell University, a publishing certificate from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Learning Design, Innovation, and Technology at Harvard's Graduate School of Education.
